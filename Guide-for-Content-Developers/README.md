# Q. Is my existing interactive content going to work in the BeLL System?

If your Content is a PDF or Movie document, your content works in the BeLL System today, see instructions in the next section.  If you have developed interactive content, there are special considerations that need to be taken. The BeLL is a server in a class room that gives students an Internet like experience.  If you content displays in a Web Browser, you're probably pretty close to getting it working on the BeLL.  However, content that works best with the BeLL is content that can be saved in the browser so that students don't require a constant connection to the BeLL.  When you content loads, if it requires constant contact with the server in order for the content to play, your content may not yet be a good fit for the BeLL. If you can currently give us each piece of content in a separate folder and have each piece of content playable when opened from those folders in a Web Browser, then you know that your content is ready to be distributed in the BeLL System.  When you've reached that point, you may then have Activity Data you want to save when a member exits your content.  OLE staff will be writing a guide on how to do that soon. 

Here are the three questions to ask when understanding if your content is a good fit for the BeLL.

1. Does the content display in a Web Browser?
2. After the content loads and before the end of the content, does it require constant contact with the server for the content to continue working?
3. Can you give us each piece of content in a separate folder and have each piece of content playable when opened from those folders in a Web Browser?


# Getting video content into the BeLL System

Because the BeLL Apps is built on Open Web Standards that work in browsers, we suggest you format your videos in the WEBM format.
If your videos are not already in the WEBM format, you can convert them using the free and Open Source software, [Miro Video Converter](http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/).
