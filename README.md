# BeLL System Documentation

This documentation is a work in progress.  
It does not necessarily represent the most up to date designs we are currently working with but it's getting pretty close.
If you want to keep track or participate on the bleeding edge of what we are working on, sign up for the [Ground Computing email listserv](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/groundcomputing)!
Your inquiries are quite welcome.
